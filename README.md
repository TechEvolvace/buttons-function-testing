# Testing Grounds for Buttons and Getting Inputs 

It's time to set an experimenting ground for discovering unique ways to get user inputs. 

## Update: 

Experiment 1 - 5 are now completely functional as intended! 

## Experiment 1 
* Basic example of an input area and a button that displays a number the user entered! 
* Assigned a function that gets activated by an click on Experiment 1's Submit Button to that button's onclick property in JavaScript!
* Used the button element to create the button, but didn't apply any styling 
* Findings: 
  * Without any condiitonal statement to verify that the input the user enters is a number, it will display anything the user enters!
  * The .value gets whatever the user enters in Experiment 1's input area and converts it into a string value! 
  * Assigning a function to a button's onclick property will run that assigned function only when that button is clicked!
